    "    Python uses indentation to mark code blocks (such as loops, conditionals, and functions).\n",

    "3. Syntax Errors:\n",
    "    Incorrect indentation leads to IndentationError.\n",
    "    Python relies on consistent indentation to determine block boundaries.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "if True:\n",
